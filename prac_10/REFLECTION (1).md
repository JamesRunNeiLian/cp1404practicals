What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?
I've started to allocate more dedicated time to practicing coding exercises outside of class, ensuring I fully understand the concepts before moving on. This change has helped me solidify my understanding of key programming principles, which I was previously rushing through.

What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?
I need to improve my time management, particularly in balancing my workload across different subjects. I also plan to approach assignments earlier rather than closer to the deadline, so I have more time to refine my work and seek help if needed.

What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?
I'm doing well in actively participating in tutorials and engaging with the practical exercises. I've been consistent in attending lectures and reviewing materials afterward, which has helped reinforce my learning. I plan to continue this disciplined approach.

What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
I need to stop procrastinating when it comes to starting larger projects. Procrastination has led to unnecessary stress and a rushed understanding of complex topics. By starting earlier, I can manage my workload more effectively and produce higher-quality work.

What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?
I would suggest incorporating more real-world projects into the curriculum that simulate what we might encounter in the industry. These projects would give us practical experience and help bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and its application in real-world scenarios.
